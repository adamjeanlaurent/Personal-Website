            I'm studying Computer Science at the University Of Rhode Island. I've been a lifelong builder, whether it with Legos, Bionicles, or puzzles.  I've also been lifelong lover of tech, especially computers, and Computer Science is the embodiment of these two traits. 

            I'm an aspiring software engineer with a strong interest in backend development, I have experience building full web applications through side projects i've uploaded to my Github account, and workflow, team work, and mobile development experience through my internship at Microsoft.
